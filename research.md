Our research covers a range of activities centred on **Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID)** technology.

---

## Projects  
- **KIDSpec** — A prototype MKID-based spectrograph for faint astrophysical targets.  
- **Detector Development** — Fabrication and characterisation of MKIDs at cryogenic temperatures.  
- **Optical Design & Coupling** — Beam-splitters, fibre coupling and system integration.  
- **Time-Domain Astronomy** — Using MKIDs to study variable sources and transient events.

---

## Facilities & Methods  
We leverage the **Durham University physics laboratories**, **cryogenic systems**, and **instrumentation expertise** to realise these aims.
