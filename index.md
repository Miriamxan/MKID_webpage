We specialise in developing **Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs)** for next-generation astronomical instrumentation — combining photon-counting, energy resolution and time-domain capabilities.

We are part of the [Centre for Advanced Instrumentation (CfAI)](https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/advanced-instrumentation/) and collaborate with international research teams to push the boundaries of astrophysics and instrumentation.
