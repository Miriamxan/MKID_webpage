# About the MKID Durham Group

The **Durham MKID Group** is developing detector and instrument technologies for time-domain astronomy.  
Our research aims to demonstrate the capabilities of MKIDs for **energy-resolved spectroscopy** and **high time-resolution photometry**.

### Current Projects
- KIDSpec: A prototype MKID-based spectrograph concept.  
- Detector testing and characterization.  
- Optical design and software development for future MKID instruments.
